		<h1>THE PLYFE PLATFORM ALLOWS ANYONE TO TURN <br>
			DIGITAL CONTENT INTO RICH, INTERACTIVE EXPERIENCES.<br>
			[NO CODING REQUIRED]</h1>
	</div>

	<div class="maintext">
		<p>We believe that digital should be a dialogue. Our time spent with electronic media increases daily - Plyfe’s  mission is to make that time participatory. That’s why we developed the Plyfe Platform, so anyone can easily and affordably make interactive experiences that can be published anywhere, adding a dialogue to digital interactions allowing companies to talk with consumers in digital versus at them.<br><br>

		Todays consumers don’t scroll through pages, we swipe to find what catches our eyes, we don’t just view pictures, we capture moments and share them around the world, we have a voice and opinions and want them heard. With new digital mechanics popping up and behaviors forming every day Plyfe is productizing the most popular mobile and web experiences for customers to turn content into an interactive dialogue with their digital audiences driving engagement, sales, audience understanding and so much more. <br><br>

		This proud to be made in NYC company attracts people from around the world and believes in living life to its fullest, delivering on the vast opportunities of digital and that the people you're building a product with are as important as the product, maybe more. <br><br>

		Love, Plyfe
