        <p class="c0"><span class="c2">Plyfe takes your privacy seriously. We will not sell, lease, or exchange your personal data to, or otherwise share your personal data with, third parties in ways other than described in this Privacy Policy. By using Plyfe, including services available at the plyfe.com domains, you are using a service provided by Plyfe, Inc. (collectively, the &ldquo;Service&rdquo;) and you agree to be bound by the Terms of Service and this Privacy Policy. Some capitalized terms used in this Privacy Policy and not otherwise defined may be defined in the Terms of Service. This Privacy Policy only addresses activities from our servers.&nbsp;</span></p>

During our account registration process, we will collect an email address, your first and last name, and a password from you. You must provide all of this information in order to obtain an account. After completing our registration form, you may receive a welcome email describing your new Plyfe account, and how to access that account.

In addition, once in our system, website owners will have the opportunity to review and modify any information entered into their website. Since we do not have full control over how members run their individual sites, this privacy policy does not apply to any hosted Plyfe website that you do not own. You should check that you trust the owner of a particular website before submitting personally identifiable information on that site.&nbsp;</span></p>
