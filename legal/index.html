        <h4>General Promotions Terms and Conditions</h4>
        <p>Promotions: The Service may from time to time make available certain sweepstakes, contests, giveaways and other promotions (collectively "Promotions"). Your participation in any such Promotions is subject to and governed by this Terms of Service and any other additional specific terms and conditions as set forth on any specific page for any such Promotion on the Service. All such Promotion terms and conditions are hereby incorporated by reference into these Terms of Service</p>
        <p>NO PURCHASE NECESSARY TO ENTER OR CLAIM PRIZE. A PURCHASE WILL NOT INCREASE YOUR CHANCES OF WINNING.<br>These General Promotions Terms and Conditions are applicable to each Promotion offered on Plyfe.me (the "Website").<br>From time to time Plyfe Inc., which maintains an office at 62 Grand St. New York, NY 10013, will offer and/or host periodic sweepstakes, giveaways, auctions and other promotions (each, a “Promotion”) on the Website. In some cases, a Promotion will be sponsored by Plyfe, and in other cases a Promotion will be sponsored by a third party identified on the specific landing page at the Website for that particular Promotion and hosted by Plyfe (each such sponsor, a “Promotion Sponsor”). Each such Promotion will be subject to and governed by these General Promotions Terms and Conditions and the additional specific terms and conditions as set forth on any specific landing page for any such Promotion on the Website (each such Promotion specific landing page, a “Promotion Site,” and together with these General Promotions Terms and Conditions, the “Official Rules”). Unless otherwise indicated on the specific Promotion Site, each Promotion begins at 12:00:01 a.m. ET on the date set forth on the Promotion Site (the “Promotion Start Date”) and will run until 11:59:59 p.m. ET on the date set forth on the Promotion Site or until the fixed number of entries indicated on the Promotion Site are received, whichever occurs first (the “Promotion End Date”) (each such period referred to herein as the Promotion Period). These Promotions are in no way sponsored, endorsed or administered by, or associated with, Facebook. You are providing your information to Plyfe and the applicable third party Promotion Sponsor and not to Facebook.</p>
        <p><strong>1. HOW TO ENTER:</strong><br>Unless otherwise indicated on the specific Promotion Site, to enter a Promotion, visit the Website during the Promotion Period and click the Play Now button for the applicable Promotion. Each entrant will be eligible to receive at least (1) entry into each such Promotion, unless otherwise indicated on the specific Promotion Site. Participation in any Promotion is voluntary and does not require you to purchase anything from the Promotion Sponsor. No illegible, incomplete, forged or altered entries will be accepted. To be eligible for a prize for a particular Promotion, entries must be received by the applicable Promotion End Date. All entries are subject to the Promotion Sponsor’s Privacy Policy and Terms of Use.</p>
        <p><strong>2. PRIZE:</strong><br>The prize descriptions, the total approximate retail value of all prizes and the number of winners to be selected for each Promotion will be set forth on the applicable Promotion Site. Additional terms and conditions may apply to winner’s use of the prize, as set forth on the specific Promotion Site. The odds of winning a Promotion are determined by the number of eligible entries received by the applicable Promotion End Date. If a Promotion limits the number of entries, the odds of winning that Promotion will be the number of prizes divided by the number of entries permitted. For example, for a Promotion with one prize, a total limit of 5000 entries and a limit of one entry per person, the odds of winning are 1 in 5000. Allow three to four weeks after validation of arrangement for receipt of prize. The actual number of prizes awarded for a particular Promotion is based on the number of eligible entries received during the applicable Promotion Period. There is no substitution, cash equivalent or transfer of prizes allowed. Each winner will be solely responsible for all other expenses not specifically set forth in the Official Rules. The Promotion Sponsor reserves the right to substitute prizes of equal or greater value. No other substitution or transfer of prizes permitted. The Promotion Sponsor is responsible only for prize delivery; not responsible for prize utility, quality or otherwise. In order to receive a prize, winner may be required to provide proof of identification. Taxes on any prize are the sole responsibility of winner. The winner of any prize with a value of $600 or greater will be issued a 1099 U.S. tax form for the retail value of the prize.</p>
        <p><strong>3. ELIGIBILITY:</strong><br>Each Promotion is open only to registered members of the Website who are legal residents of the United States, and at least 13 years old at the time of entry. Only one Website membership account per person. No collaboration amongst any individual users to obtain an advantage or increase one’s probability of winning unless otherwise indicated. Entries are limited to individuals only; commercial enterprises and business entities are not eligible. By participating in any Promotion, each entrant accepts the conditions stated in the Official Rules, agrees to be bound by the decisions of Plyfe and the applicable third party Promotion Sponsor and warrants that he or she is eligible to participate in each such Promotion. Employees, independent contractors, officers, and directors of Plyfe and any applicable third party Promotion Sponsor, and their affiliates, subsidiaries, advertising, promotion, and fulfillment agencies, and legal advisors, and their immediate family members and persons living in the same household, are not eligible to participate in any Promotion. EACH PROMOTION IS VOID WHERE PROHIBITED OR RESTRICTED BY LAW and is subject to applicable federal, state and local laws, statutes, ordinances and regulations.</p>
        <p><strong>4. SELECTION OF WINNERS:</strong><br>Following each Promotion End Date, the winner or winners will be selected by Plyfe, the applicable third party Promotion Sponsor or their designee based on the criteria indicated on the applicable Promotion Site. Winners for each Promotion will be selected from all eligible entries received by the Promotion End Date for such Promotion. Plyfe will aggressively inspect the authenticity of all entries to determine if they are a natural person. Only one winner per household or family unit. Any winner who is deemed to have a fraudulent, duplicate, or unauthentic account will be deemed to be ineligible. Winners for each Promotion will be notified by mail, telephone or email using the information provided by the entrant, within 30 days of the Promotion End Date for such Promotion. In the event a potential winner does not accept or claim the prize, is ineligible, the prize or prize notification is not deliverable, or is disqualified for any reason, Promotion Sponsor will award the applicable prize to an alternate winner by random drawing from among all remaining eligible entries. Alternate drawings will be held every 5 business days after the original 30 day prize claim expiration period, for a reasonable period of time. All entries received for a Promotion during the applicable Promotion Period will be canceled after the winner is selected for such Promotion Period. Plyfe and the applicable third party Promotion Sponsor is not responsible for and shall not be liable for late, lost, misdirected or unsuccessful efforts to notify winner. Where lawful, winner may be required to sign and return Plyfe’s form of Publicity Consent and Liability Release. If a winner fails or refuses to sign such Publicity Consent and Liability Release in the manner and within the time as requested by Plyfe or the applicable third party Promotion Sponsor, such winner may be disqualified and an alternate winner may be selected.</p>
        <p>Achievements: The service may provide you with opportunities to earn achievements through activities on the Service and other third party websites and services. The achievements may come in various forms such as digital rewards in the form of advancement in games and access to different levels. Achievements also may be prizes of real life goods and entries into sweepstakes promotions, as permitted by Plyfe from time to time. Achievements may appear on the service in the form of Badges or other visual representations.
